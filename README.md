# Grand-Project: Research and developing Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management in Web Application

**Grand-Project** is a security tool designed to help organizations **identify, monitor, and manage** their web application assets. By leveraging **Attack Surface Management (ASM)** principles, this tool enhances visibility into potential security risks and aids in **threat classification and incident response**.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- ✅ **Website Scanning** – Identifies security risks in web applications.  
- ✅ **Attack Surface Analysis** – Detects potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
- ✅ **CVE Database Integration** – Lists known vulnerabilities by pulling CVEs from NVD.  
- ✅ **User Authentication & Role Management** – Secures access to the platform.  
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring** – Continuously tracks security posture changes.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- 🔹 **FastAPI** – Handles website scanning and security analysis.  
- 🔹 **ReactJS** – Renders and displays scanning results in an interactive dashboard.  
- 🔹 **.NET** – Manages authentication and retrieves CVE data from NVD.  

## 🌍 Use Cases  
- 🔸 Security teams monitoring web applications for vulnerabilities.  
- 🔸 Pentesters identifying high-risk assets before an engagement.  
- 🔸 Organizations tracking changes in their attack surface over time.
